"""Business-time rescaling: seasonality-robust event-time deseasonalization.

Motivation (Filimonov & Sornette 2015; see the regime-switching trap test
in tests/estimators/test_hawkes.py,
`test_regime_switching_poisson_produces_spurious_endogeneity_trap`): fitting
a Hawkes model directly on clock-time event data cannot distinguish genuine
self-excitation from a time-varying but non-self-exciting baseline rate
mu(t) — e.g. the intraday U-shape / funding-hour clustering universally
present in crypto/equity microstructure data. Both a likelihood fit and the
model-free count-variance estimator report spurious positive endogeneity
when the true process is just a non-stationary-rate Poisson process.

This module implements the standard fix: a deterministic time change to
"business time" (also called "theta time" / operational time in the market
microstructure literature) that flattens the known intraday seasonality
BEFORE any Hawkes fitting is attempted. Given a piecewise-constant estimate
of the intraday rate profile rate(s) (period 24h, repeating across days,
mean exactly 1 by construction), business time is

    tau(t) = integral_0^t rate(s) ds

Under tau, a Poisson process with rate mu(t) = mu_bar * rate(time_of_day(t))
becomes a HOMOGENEOUS Poisson process with rate mu_bar in tau-time (standard
time-change / random time-change theorem for point processes), so a Hawkes
fit performed on tau(events) is no longer confounded by the daily cycle.

Usage: estimate the profile from (ideally) a longer/representative sample
via `intraday_rate_profile`, then rescale the event times you intend to fit
via `rescale_to_business_time` before calling `fit_hawkes_exp` /
`branching_count_variance` from microstructure.estimators.hawkes.

    """Estimate the normalized intraday event-rate profile from event times.

    `ts` is a 1-D array of int64 epoch-milliseconds (UTC). If timestamps
    originate from a polars `Datetime` series, the caller is responsible for
    converting first, e.g. `df["ts"].dt.epoch("ms").to_numpy()`.

    Each event is assigned to one of `n_bins` equal-width bins covering the
    24h time-of-day-in-UTC cycle (bin width = 86_400_000 / n_bins ms), by
    `(ts % MS_PER_DAY) // bin_width_ms`. The returned profile is the per-bin
    event count divided by the mean per-bin count (total_events / n_bins),
    so the profile has mean exactly 1 by construction — a value of 2.0 in a
    bin means events are twice as frequent in that time-of-day window as the
    all-day average.

    Any bin with zero observed events is floored at `_EMPTY_BIN_FLOOR`
    (0.01) rather than left at 0, to avoid division-by-zero / a permanently
    frozen business clock in `rescale_to_business_time`'s integral. This
    floor is a deliberate approximation: it assumes sparse bins are due to
    sampling noise (short/data-starved windows), not a truly dead trading
    period, and callers estimating a profile from very short or highly
    intermittent samples should be aware the floor can distort empty hours.
    The floor is applied BEFORE the mean-1 normalization (floor, then
    renormalize by dividing by the floored array's own mean), so the
    returned profile's mean is always exactly 1 — including when bins were
    floored — which in turn keeps `rescale_to_business_time`'s "one full day
    integrates to exactly 86400 seconds" property exact rather than
    approximate.

    `ts` is a 1-D array of int64 epoch-milliseconds (UTC), and `profile` is
    an `n_bins`-length normalized rate profile as returned by
    `intraday_rate_profile` (piecewise-constant over time-of-day, period
    24h, repeating across days). Returns a float64 array (same length as
    `ts`) of business-time coordinates in seconds:

        tau(t) = integral_0^t rate(s) ds,  anchored so tau(ts[0]) == 0.

    The integral is computed exactly for a piecewise-constant rate: for a
    query time t, decompose t = n_full_days * 86400s + within_day_seconds.
    Each full day contributes exactly `sum(profile) * bin_width_seconds`
    (== 86400 seconds, since profile has mean 1 by construction) to tau.
    The partial day contributes the cumulative integral of `profile` over
    whole bins strictly before the query's bin, plus a linear partial-bin
    term `profile[bin_idx] * (leftover time within the bin)`. This is
    vectorized (no per-event Python loop): every event's decomposition is
    computed with numpy array ops.

    Determinism: identical input arrays always produce identical output
